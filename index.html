                        as HTML, Python, SQL. Hopefully, I will breeze through my university years, meet a lot of wonderful friends, and get

                        numbers. As a result, I aspire to work as a data scientist in the future. 

                        I hope to improve my cooperation skills through this project and build networking with others in this course.

            <p class="info-text">
            Our group project is about how a game can act as an effective learning environment by integrating 
            reflection into the process of play while studying in lecture or tutorial class. The game here 
            resembles a legendary Mario game, however, the extraordinary here is the unique playstyle, a character 
            in game that has to answer the question as soon as possible to get a higher mark and pass to another 
            high level . The player uses the directional arrows on the keyboard to negotiate the direction of character 
            to jump or to go left and right.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            The point element in the game could help students stay focused on their studying and increase the 
            competitiveness among students in class to optimize the efficiency in the field of education.

          <li class="geninfo">Motivation:</li>
          <div class="info">
            All of us chose this idea because we wanted to experience and learn how to build a game by ourselves. 
            One study of the popular multiple-choice quiz game Kahoot found that it improved students’ attitudes 
            toward learning and boosted their academic scores. Most games are about entertaining and valuable awards 
            that make individuals have a sense of achievement, however we want to create a brand new value in games 
            that are educational. We do believe that our project is interesting because it can be applied in reality 
            and brings huge efficiency. This will be in fit with current IT trends, because people's demand for 
            entertainment in the midst of the Covid-19 outbreak is higher than ever. Furthermore, a  future manager 
            should be able to see that we are tech enthusiasts that are always up to date on the IT industry and have 
            game development experience as a result of this.

            Among countless entertainment games, one stood out the most and they are Nintendo. Nintendo is a global 
            Japanese video game corporation headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. They are well-known for creating video games 
            and game consoles. However, they mostly focus on the game for amusement purposes, whereas our venture aims 
            to transcend beyond this. We decided to include some interesting features in our product, such as a quiz 
            and a shopping cart. Students may engage more in class with quizzes, while the store features with accumulated 
            coins generate a sense of success in players, keeping them in the game as long as feasible.

            While all members of our group have a huge interest in the game industry, we decided to create a game 
            by ourselves. However, due to the members lacking experience and knowledge about programming,  the aim 
            of this project is to create a basic platform game. A platform game or platformer is a style of game 
            where the player has to control the character moving through obstacles in the given environment to 
            complete the level.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            First of all, our game is programmed using pygame, which is a suite of cross-platform Python modules 
            for creating video games. It offers sound and graphics libraries that may be utilized with the Python 
            programming language. There are a range of basic features that the game needs to follow:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Game world: An environment for the character to move around </li>
              <li>Game main character: A figure that player can control to play this game</li>
              <li>Obstacles: Block the player in some locations</li>
              <li>Enemies: Locate in specific locations in each map, they try to attack when encounter the player</li>
              <li>Stuff to collect: Bonus point if the player collect on the way</li>
              <li>Quests to complete: tasks that required player to complete in order to gain rewards</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="info-text">
            Our first priority is to make the game run smoothly with those functions as mentioned above. Besides that, 
            we are developing extra levels for multiple difficulties and various designs for the map as well.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Moreover, we also design a website to present our project with a better view and easier access to each part.
            </p>
            </ol>

          <p class="info-text">
            In this section, we are going to describe our project details, how we have planned and collaborated to 
            make this project come out successfully. We have created tasks for the group to follow and to track our 
            own progress.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Group formation and idea discussion</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Our group formed at the beginning of the semester since we were all familiar with each other before the course started. 
            This made our teamwork and communication much easier. We planned to choose an idea for the project to follow and then 
            recognized that all of us have the same interest in games, so we decided to create a game based on what we are learning, 
            which is Python. 
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Planning</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            First and foremost, we split the project into small parts for easy to maintain and each person has a specific role for 
            each part. However, we also set up deadlines every week and help each other for their parts when they are struggling, 
            we work together to finish everything before the deadline.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Secondly, we work as a team to complete multiple tasks that require collaboration.  We will be actively involved in daily 
            communication with other team members for improvements and help because this requires a lot of group activities.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Next, we would like to make a website to present our group project documentation, which is in charge of Tin. Besides Python, 
            we are using HTML and CSS for front-end website creation. The website will contain the main idea of this project and the 
            summary of the documentation.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            About our code, we decided 2 people to take over all of the code creation. These people will have less tasks on the 
            documentation, however, they have responsibility for the whole game as the main code writer and game designer.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Finally, we will make the PowerPoint slides as the last part after we finish making the game and website. It is also 
            the last part of the project.   
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Docummentation</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            To ensure that the documentation is consistent, we are using the same rules and font designs. For a clear 
            visual, we will mostly use Times New Roman font with a font size of 12 and 1.15 line spacing.   
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            All documentations are stored on Google Docs and everyone has access to update and record the progress 
            online regularly.   
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Collaboration tools</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            For efficiency, a group project requires an atmosphere that encourages cooperation and teamwork. 
            Furthermore, frequent communication helps in the resolution of miscommunications and ensures that everyone 
            is meeting deadlines and taking responsibility for their job.   
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            We choose Discord and Messenger as our main communication tools since they are very familiar with our group 
            members. We use Messenger regularly to communicate about daily problems and goals of the project since 
            everyone has a Facebook account. Discord is for weekly meetings and file sharing.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            For code collaboration, we use GitHub as a cloud repository platform to store our code and keep track of changes.  
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
            Google Docs is going to be our main tool of keeping track of our documentation file, where everyone has a part 
            in the report and will be updating regularly.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Game Design</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            First of all, we will try to make the game playable and contain basic functions that we designed at first 
            and follow standard platformer rules. There will be a game main character moving through the map avoiding 
            obstacles and enemies to complete a level. Moreover, we want to make our game more prestigious by adding 
            sound effects and animations. 
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Web Design</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Tin is the one who came up with an idea of using a website to demonstrate the project. He also learnt about 
            web programming languages such as HTML CSS and Javascript so Tin is going to take care of this part.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Presentation</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            We will start preparing our presentation slides last week when we all finished the game and the website. 
            The presentation will include the main ideas of this project and we will try to make the duration as close 
            as possible to meet the requirements.
            </p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Progress</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Due to early group formation, great communication and teamwork, we have quite a lot of time for completing 
            this project. We do not have any time management problems at all and that is a huge advantage for us.  We 
            started researching Pygame and making games with Pygame from the very beginning. We spent a lot of time 
            understanding the game logic, fundamentals and art design. We also invest our time in exploring web design 
            and development. Despite being new to game and website development, we have done better than we expected. 
            We have created a playable game with certain levels and fulfill all requirements that we planned from the 
            beginning. Our website is well-designed and includes everything we need to demonstrate about the project.

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Character and background:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            With our lack of knowledge and experience, we will design one character with a simple background. The landing page of the game will display 
            necessary categories for players to manipulate like start or quit the game, and show the menu of levels. Below is the figure for illustration:</p>
            <img style = "width:300px" = src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/943492545386803242/976163565604061184/unknown.png"
            </p>  
            <p class="info-text">
            The ground is divided into many layers and requires the player to navigate the character to move to the right direction to complete the level. 
            We will show an illustrative image below:</p>
            <img style = "width:300px" = src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/943492545386803242/976121487910133790/unknown.png"

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Obstacles, enemies and collective coins for rewards:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            In order to make the game become more interesting, there are static and dynamic obstacles, as well as collective coins for certain objectives. 
            The amount of obstacles appearing corresponding to the difficulty of the game increases as the higher levels. The coin earned can be exchanged 
            for rewards such as skins, additional tools for characters, etc.Thus, players’ efforts have to be put in the game more to achieve the optimal 
            goals of the level.</p>
            <img style = "width:300px" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/943492545386803242/976143122868359168/unknown.png"

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Quizzes for bonus coin:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            After completing one level, there will be a quiz for players. These quizzes are mainly created to provide players useful knowledge as well as help 
            them review lessons they have learnt. The quizzes could be in any category and any field; however, as students in the IT field, we will focus on 
            questions related to the Information Technology field. Once they answer the quiz correctly, they will get bonus coins, this will encourage players 
            to participate in all activities of the game. Thus, players will not only enjoy playing the game, but also have a chance to review and learn new things 
            that could be useful for their study. Here is the illustration for the interface of the quiz section.</p>
            <img style = "width:300px" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/943492545386803242/976158807774343168/unknown.png"

            <p class="info-text">
            As we have mentioned, collected coins can be used to purchase desired items in the Shop section. There will be different types of items such as skin, 
            boosting or supportive tools for the character, etc. This section will be designed as the following illustration.</p>
            <img style = "width:300px" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/943492545386803242/976517545161019453/image.jpg"

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Multiple levels:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            There are many levels with various kinds of map design, objects and difficulties. The game is designed as a long-term game model, so the player will enjoy 
            exploring and conquering each level because of their curiosity. Because there are multiple levels, there will be a level menu like the following illustration.</p>
            <img style = "width:300px" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/943492545386803242/976161615307227136/unknown.png"

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Record system:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            We will also need a record system to record the levels completed, coins collected or the reward that players have exchanged. Due to that, when the player opens 
            the game, all those data will be automatically updated.</p>
        <p class="info-text">

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Music and sound effect:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Music and sound effects are also an important factor making the game attract more people. The music will be vastly familiar and also melodious, reminding 
            them of their childhood, that is the legendary Mario song. Furthermore, the soundtrack for certain circumstances will be also added like when the character 
            dies, collect coins, correct/wrong answer.</p>

            <p class="info-text">
            A simple game with basic concepts is accomplished for reference. This will be the main game of our project as we have proposed earlier. One the other hand, 
            there are advanced parts that we do not have enough time and knowledge to implement, such as quizzes, record system and rewards.</p>
        <p class="info-text">LIMIT
            </p>    
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Record system and rewards:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            As mentioned earlier, our program will have the record system to record information including coins and levels completed. However, we do not have 
            enough knowledge to build a system that can automatically record, so the player can not have enough coins to purchase rewards. Moreover, the rewards 
            also require designing skills and time, so we decided to eliminate this section, also.</p>
            <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Quizzes:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            Since four weeks is not enough for us to do research and learn how to integrate this section into our game. Thus, this section is for further 
            development in our project.</p>

        <div id="tool_tech" class="info" style="display: none;">
            <p class="info-text">There are several tools and technologies that are required for the creation of the game 
              as well as its continued development:
            </p>

          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Pygame package from Python:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            The pygame library is an open-source module for the Python programming language specifically intended 
            to help people  make games and other multimedia applications. However, due to our lack of experience 
            in programming, it seems to us that this tool would take many weeks to get used to it. Phu, who plays 
            a main role in developing games, has done some research to find tutorials on Youtube that help us to 
            deal with this challenge.
            </p>
          <b style="color: #E07A5F;">Adobe Photoshop CC:</b>
            <p class="info-text">
            This design application belongs to Adobe’s toolkit and is free for RMIT  students. It’s also a powerful 
            tool to help Phu design a character and a basic background for our project.

          Testing
        </div>
        <div id="test" class="info" style="display: none;">
          Our group will divide the testing stage into certain steps. The first step is to test code functions and behaviors 
          by playing the game and debugging any problems that arise. For the game logic, we will let two testers who specialize 
          in IT major and also one consultant in Student Academic Success (SAS) test the game. Due to that, they can give us 
          helpful advice and we find out inappropriate points in the game to fix. After completing the technical step, we will 
          move to the social step, which is the attraction. Assuming that our game becomes popular as an educational combined 
          game model as we need to provide people with useful information from the quizzes and also a good experience. Therefore, 
          we need to collect lots of feedback from players in order to improve the quality of our game. To do that, we will urge 
          our friends in class to try that game.

           We might experience unexpected boundaries that dial us back during our IT project; accordingly, we should be totally ready consistently. Correspondence and 
           collaboration are two perspectives that could immensely affect project results. During bunch work, there might be gambles that we didn't expect. Some colleagues

            we should resolve the issue of utilization crashes. Perhaps the most ridiculously upsetting issue for us is programming inconveniences, as PyCharm has blunders and errors 
            brought about by contents or server insecurity. Since we recently got guidelines from the teacher and had examined how to utilize all of Visual Studio Code's elements, we 
            can utilize another IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code as another option assuming that PyCharm crashes. Visual Studio Code has various in-application highlights like 
            PyCharm.We'll have to use Pygame to create and run the game, which is another part of Python for us this semester; therefore, becoming acclimated to it and each of its 
            elements will require some investment. To save time and make an all around organized and engaging plan application, the task's essential engineers would have to comprehend 
            Pygame prior to starting the application improvement process.

            are risks. The product's prosperity is not set in stone by the amount it is utilized. It will interface with benefits assuming an organization constructs programming

          As a result of our team's formation since the beginning of the semester, we have known enough about the skills and work attitude of each member. 
          Thanks to this, it is highly beneficial for our group to be able to allocate the appropriate tasks for everyone that they do best to acquire 
          more efficiently. First, we use Messenger to discuss and send documents related to the assignment. Every Saturday evening, our group meetings 
          take place on the Discord platform, where you can call and share the screen to ensure that all members can see what’s going on. By doing this, 
          we could tackle the problem together and each meeting would typically last 2 hours.We update and analyze the project's development throughout 
          the meeting, as well as discuss what we did last week and what we'll accomplish next week. Tin also takes responsibility for writing 
          Meeting Minutes on Google Docs so that we can review them later and those who are unable to attend the meeting may read them and keep up 
          with the assignment's progress. Before the weekly meetings, each member will note down what they want to add such as any innovative ideas 
          for the game’s future development, or recommendations for the report or website. Last but not least, we choose Google Docs to write the 
          report since it is more convenient for us to manage our group process and amend the report during our weekly meeting.

        <p class="info-text">
            With a limit of time, we have learnt about the phases needed for our project and built a game prototype for our outcome. The game is built with 
            basic functionalities for the player to have an experience. There is a landing menu for the player to start or exit the game by using the mouse 
            to click. The player is able to navigate the character to move by the arrow key presses and jump by the space keypress. Once the player moves the 
            character to the complete gate, it will pass to the next level. Beside that, there are static and dynamic obstacles making the level more difficult 
            to complete. There are also coins as other objectives for the player to collect. However, because the game is still simple with very few features, 
            people can just play for relaxing or preference. As we mentioned above, this is a mockup, so there will be further improvements that need to be 
            implemented. We need to add the Level Menu and Shop section for players to use the collected coins to purchase items. Moreover, we will add the 
            educational quizzes section in the middle of each level, which serves for educational purposes as our idea at the beginning.</p>

      <dd> The good thing is that all members in our team want to be proactive in this project, so we held the first meeting quite soon 
        after forming the group to start discussing the topic of our project. About our communication, one meeting per week is required 
        whether it is online or face-to-face, so we can keep track and set the goals together with the deadline for each week. No one missed 
        the meetings as all members are responsible for this project. Our team is quite flexible in the task assignment phase, each member can 
        choose the desired task to take charge of. We were surprised since we realized that we are all newbies with lack of IT knowledge, so we 
        were ready for any difficulties that we would face. As we had assumed earlier, there were difficulties during the working process. In 
        discussions, we usually struggle and hesitate in decision-making situations; everyone was not really active to share opinions and sometimes 
        misunderstood each other in the early stage because we were just getting familiar with each other. There’s no members that specialized in 
        HTML before, so two members in our team mainly took charge of that part and learned on the internet as beginners to build the group website. 
        As we have stressed throughout the course, we have extended the deadline for tasks several times. This is because we as a team failed to 
        recognize the complexity of the problem and overly focused on the advanced features of our project, so we decided to just build a mockup 
        game with basic foundation. There was a Github repository of the team for keeping track; however, our team did not utilize this platform 
        optimally as we were getting familiar with it.  Despite many difficulties arising during our progress, we have found solutions to manage 
        and solve the problems to accomplish the project perfectly.. Recognizing the importance of communication in teamwork, we have also tried 
        to talk more to each other and began to coordinate more smoothly. All team members tried to help each other when anyone struggled with 
        their tasks. This project has given us lots of lessons. We now get more experience and know how to work in a team effectively due to this 
        course. We realize that spare time is also significant while doing the project as everyone can have time to relax. Everyone in our team has 
        put lots of effort into the project and we are all satisfied with the result.</dd>

      <dd>Throughout this course and especially this project, I think we have done a great job. Although the majority of our group members are 
        newcomers, I can see that everyone is working as hard as they can to achieve the goals of this semester. We faced lots of challenges while 
        studying and doing the project, however, due to great communication and cooperation, we tackled every problem in no time. Aside from the 
        project, even though I am a sophomore, this is my first time working with Linux commands and some new IT fundamentals and definitions. 
        This will help me to consolidate my knowledge about this industry. Moreover, I have the chance to make new friends, which are my four 
        teammates in this course. In conclusion, this course went well for me and it gave me the opportunity to improve my teamwork, communication 
        and time management skills. </dd>

      <dd>After learning this course, I have learned more about IT and had a chance to do a great project with my team. We encountered a lot of 
        problems at the start of the project because it was our first IT course. To become familiar with Python, we must devote a significant
         amount of time to learning and viewing video lessons. However, the project was completed with the fundamentals thanks to everyone's efforts. 
         This project taught me that cooperation is an essential ability and that individuals must communicate often in order to understand each other 
         while working. We attempted to have one face-to-face meeting every week, and we also used Discord to communicate and discuss ideas while working 
         on the project. Moreover, we also use GitHub to track the team's work, but we did not fully utilize its capabilities. Therefore, we'll need extra 
         time to familiarize ourselves with this platform. I've studied the fundamentals of HTML and will attempt to study the more complex aspects in the 
         future. Overall, our project was likewise successful, and I gained a lot of knowledge from my team members.</dd>

      <dd>I learned a lot when working in a group at the end of the assignment duration. When I initially joined this group, I was afraid that I would make 
        mistakes, but everything worked out well. During every team meeting, we accepted each other's opinions and perspectives and worked hard to develop a 
        clear understanding of how our project should appear and operate. Personally, I am kind of a listener who is hesitant to speak my mind. As a result, 
        this is not a constructive way of communication. Nonetheless, at the end of this semester, I am more confident and eager to share my thoughts and 
        provide comments on the work of other members. I believe that after this, we will be able to improve our own work because this is our first semester 
        together and there are still many flaws in our work that we need to address, so I am hopeful that we will develop ourselves in order to be better in 
        future projects. To summarize, I am delighted to have the opportunity to work with my team and attend this course. </dd>

      <dd>Before attending this course, I was just a newbie with a lack of IT knowledge. However, throughout this course, there are lots of good things 
        I have learnt from my enthusiastic teammates such as teamwork, decision-making, being proactive and programming skills. There were difficulties 
        raising up during the implementation stage that slowed our progress down such as our lack of web development skills, importing files in the right 
        direction to run the game ,etc. However, we have found ways to manage and tackle the problems successfully. I was surprised by the way my team 
        organizes and plans schedules before any implementation step which makes our process more efficient. We have been flexible and tried to help each 
        other if they struggle with assigned tasks. Although we used Github as a group platform to keep track of our progress as well as develop the project 
        more effectively, I think we have not utilized this powerful tool in an optimal way. Thus, we need more time to get familiar with this platform. 
        Overall, each member in our team has dedicated their effort and time to the project, so I am totally satisfied with our result no matter what.</dd>

      <dd>I didn't know anything about HTML, GitHub, or Linux when I initially took this course. Following half a month of concentrating on IT, I took in 
        the critical techniques for building and using Github as a work area for gatherings, as well as HTML or Linux to make a site, which I had never done, 
        and I likewise found the value of Information Technology. I've found out about specialized headways and how they impact numerous callings and 
        organizations. The groundwork of all cutting edge data handling is data innovation, some of the time known as the subsequent machine age. Moreover, 
        I met four fabulous associates who have been my most memorable new companions since starting my investigations here. I've found out about innovation

        of all cutting edge data handling. Moreover, I met four phenomenal partners who were my most memorable new companions since starting my examinations 
        here. We pick the pycharm stage to invest less energy fostering the game. One issue that emerged at the time was the trouble of learning new things; 
        regardless, we had the option to adjust and conquer this. Since our gathering individuals' timetables were almost indistinguishable, it was easy to 
        impart and share our work. Beside that, I accept the timescale is reasonable. I have a lot of chances to study, work on my undertaking, and unwind. 
        Generally speaking, our task was a triumph because of solid gathering collaboration and individual self-control.</dd>
